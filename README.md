The "Battle of Three" is a game that provides players with an opportunity to engage in a strategic competition against the Shadow Lord. This game requires the player and the Shadow Lord to choose from among three options, namely the warrior, the dragon, or the mushroom.

The warrior is known for their exceptional wisdom and strength, and has the ability to defeat the dragon. The mushroom, on the other hand, is equipped with strong poisonous fumes that can prove fatal for the warrior. Lastly, the dragon possesses the power to burn the mushroom to ashes.

It is imperative that players exercise prudence and strategic thinking in their choices, as the victor shall be determined by the highest number of victories won.
